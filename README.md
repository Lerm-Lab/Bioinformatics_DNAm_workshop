PULMO students DNA methylation worksop at cluster
## DATASET
To demonstrate the various aspects of analyzing DNA methylation data, we will be using a data, publicly available PMID: 27942592 Illumina Infinium array, 450k methylation dataset GSE85566. Genome-wide methylation data was generated from freshly isolated airway epithelial cells from 74 asthmatic and 41 nonasthmatic adults.
